## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project focuses on **Time Series Forecasting** for stock price prediction.  
I have implemented three different approaches:  

ðŸ”¹ **Prophet Model** â€“ A powerful forecasting tool from Facebook that handles seasonality and trends.  
ðŸ”¹ **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)** â€“ A classic statistical method for time series forecasting.  
ðŸ”¹ **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** â€“ A deep learning-based recurrent neural network (RNN) model designed for sequence prediction.  

The goal of this project is to compare these models and determine which one provides the most accurate predictions for stock market trends.
